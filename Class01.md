># Basic information about React and Components
>> first lets discuss the meaning of a component :
**A component modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface**

**Components have many Characteristics which are : **<br>

- Reusability : Usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications<br>
- Replaceable  :  Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.<br>
- Not context Specific  : designed to operate in different environments and contexts.<br>
- Extensible : Can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.<br>
- Encapsulated : We can Used it  without exposing any internal parts <br>
- Independent : Made in way to have minimal dependencies on other components. <br>

**Advantages of using Component−Based Design  :**<br>
- Ease of deployment : easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.<br>
- Reduced cost : The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.<br>
- Ease of development : allows development without impacting other parts of the system<br>
- Reusable : The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.<br>
- Modification of technical complexity : A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.<br>
- Reliability : system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.<br>
- System maintenance and evolution : Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.<br>
- Independent : Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.<br>


># Moving to Props by starting of with the meaning of it !<br>

**Props is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.**

But how can Props be used it react  ? 

- Pass in props as an argument
- Declare props variable(s)
- Use variable(s) in JSX template
- Pass data to props in the App component

Finally lets discuss the flow of props?
Props has a flow that is called the uni-directional flow which is a one way flow from parent to child also , props is a read only and becasue of that what comes from the parent cannot be changed by the child .

## Things I want to know more about
What does it look like implementing them in a real project and I would like to try it ourselves soon .
