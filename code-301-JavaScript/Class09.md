># Functional Programming


## Part one : 
**                **
### What is functional programming?

it means using functions to get the typical results for a powerful and maintainable software.
**                **
**                **

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?


its the function which always takes the same input and gives the same output
**                **
**                **
### What are the benefits of a pure function?


it imporves readability because of how easy we can read it and since it gives the same output
then we can easily understand how the variables depend on each other inside of it .
**                **
**                **

### What is immutability?

for the data it means the data that can't be changed structural or what is in it
**                **
**                **

### What is Referential transparency?

a term commonly used in functional programming, means that given a function and an input value, you will always receive the same output.
**                **

## Part two : 
### What is a module?

it a file that contains related code to the main code section
**                **
**                **
### What does the word ‘require’ do?

 require() is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files. require() statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object.
 **                **
 **                **
### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
Using the require built-in function with the path in the class that you want to use the moudle in it 
**                **
**                **

### What do we have to do to make a module available?

Export it , use the require and then use it .
**                **
**                **
## Things I want to know more about:
what is require used for the most .
**                **
**                **
