# State and Props
**                                                    **


## **Part 1:** <br>

**1- Render**<br><br>
**                                                    **
**2- Creating a constructor is the first step but if we want to be specific<br>
then its the initial phase when the components are on their way to the DOM.** <br>
**                                                    **
**3-<br><br>
-constructor<br>
-render<br>
-componentDidMount<br>
-React Updates<br>
-componentWillUnmount**<br>
**                                                    **

**4-  allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model).**<br>
<br>
**                                                    **
**                                                    **
## **Part 2:** <br>

**1- Whatever will be passed from the parent and won't be changed inside the component,<br>
like titles or names or depiction of something,<br>
rather than hard coding it we use props to make it dynamic it also could be an image.**<br><br>
**                                                    **
2- <br><br>
**- props you pass into a componenet and its handeled out side of their component and updated in the outside of the component** <br>
**- state is handeled inside of the component and you can update it inside the component**<br><br>
**                                                    **
**3- when the a state element changes so we rerender when want to apply new changes** .<br><br>
**                                                    **
**4- Things that you want to keep updated such as a form (it needs to be update when ever the user changes anything) or a counter** <br>
**                                                    **
**                                                    **
## Things I want to know more about
Does state have a limit of use ? and can we link two states that are in different files with each other ? 
**                                                    **
